0,I really love Among Us. The little astronaut fellows that perform tasks to move the spaceship along just warms my heart. I think Among Us is the best game ever. I hope that I am never the imposter because I would feel bad if I suffocated my friends or sabotaged the oxygen.,space
1,"So there is a singer that I really like. I hope you won't make fun of them because they're my favorite. Where she's from, there are two races: humans and giants. They both share a common ancestor, but for generations the giants have only known war. The singer must sing so that the giant race can remember their ancestry and stop attacking the humans. Her songs are very melodic and are of my favorite pop genre. I think her voice is beautiful and calming. I'm sure she has lots of fans who cheer her on every day.",music
